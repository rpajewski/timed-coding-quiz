# Timed Coding Quiz

## A Time Quiz Testing the Users Javascript Knowledge
I used minimal HTML to created a quiz to test the users javascript knowledge. The user is created with a welcome page and a start button. They also have the option to view high scores in the top left hand corner. Once the user clicks start quiz the first question will appear and the timer will start. 

The timer total is based on the amount of questions in the array * 15. 

Once the user selects an answer the program will determine if the user selected correctly or incorrectly and be prompted accordingly. If the user answers incorrectly they will be deducted 10seconds from the timer. The program will then add 1 to the current question index and pull the next question.

Once the user finishes the quiz the timer will be stopped and considered the users score. The user can enter their initials in the prompt and compare their score to other users who have used the same device to take the quiz. 

If the user runs out of time they will be promped to try again, returning them to the welcome page.
